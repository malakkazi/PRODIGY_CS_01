# PRODIGY_CS_01 - Caesar Cipher (Task 01)

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** as part of my **Cybersecurity Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.

## 🔐 Task Objective

> Create a Python program that can **encrypt** and **decrypt** text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.  
> The user should be able to:
- Input a message
- Input a shift value
- Perform encryption or decryption based on the choice

## 💻 Features

- User-friendly console input
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase characters
- Preserves spaces and punctuation
- Modular functions for encrypt and decrypt

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
